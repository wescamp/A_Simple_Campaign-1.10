#textdomain wesnoth-A_Simple_Campaign

# The following define ... enddef is a macro. Its contents get inserted at that point where it is called using {STORY}.
# It needs to be placed=defined=read by the wesnoth engine before (above where) it is called.
# Macros are different from functions that you may have seen in other programming languages.
# The most important difference for you is that functions can be defined below the position where they are used (in the same file).
# Doing this with a macro will just cause it not to work. Starting with the 1.9 branch of wesnoth you get concrete preprocessor error messages about which macros/files you are calling could not be found.
# This thing also depends on the "inclusion order" - to find out more about it read the preprocessor reference in the wml reference.
